                                <p class="grey-text">I joined Alexandria Treetop Toastmasters, a local public speaking club, in May of 2017 and served as the Vice President for Public Relations. I took the time to learn the club, the community and worked on building relationships.</p>
                                
                                 <p class="grey-text">After only one year of joining, the club members elected me for the president's role. I devised a new plan to run the club and offered financial incentives for members to commit to the club for longer periods. The aim was to build a rapport between them and the club. I established an online payment system for dues and introduced a new friendship system to strengthen member relationship.</p>
                                
                                <p class="grey-text">Due to these efforts, the club turned around over the course of two years from a small underdog club to one of the most successful and competitive in the district. My leadership strategy rejected domination despite its success. During my year of service, I recognized the club's need for fresh leadership. So, I motivated and nurtured a brand new officer team through out the year to serve the club for the next term and stepped down.</p>
                                
                                <p class="grey-text">The club's success story was highlighted by District 27, compromised of 150 clubs, as its top success story of the year</p>

                                <p class="grey-text">During my first year with the club, I took on another challenge. I was the first officer in the club to pursue and adopt a new curriculum for public speaking online. I enjoyed exploring uncharted territory. This led to the club's first triple crown award for achieving three advanced awards in less than a year. I gave more than a hundred speeches to audience members that ranged from 10 to 200 attendees and received valuable feedback from public speech professionals. Ultimately, I progressed to be assigned as an evaluator for other public speakers. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="grey-text">I joined my first speech contest winning Best Humorous Speech. From thereon, I won several public speaking awards including Best Speech in the city of Arlington, the 2nd Best Speech in the Division of Southern DC and the Best Speech Evaluator (feedback on another public speake) in the city of Alexandria.
